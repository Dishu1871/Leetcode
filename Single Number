Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
// code for this question
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
       int answer=0;
       for(int value: nums){
        answer^=value;
       }
       return answer;
    }
};
